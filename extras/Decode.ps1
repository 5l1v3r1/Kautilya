.SYNOPSIS
Script for Kautilya to decode the data encoded by DNS TXT and POST exfiltration methods.

.DESCRIPTION
The script asks for an encoded string as an option, decodes it and writes to a file "decoded.txt" in the current working directory.
Both the encoding and decoding is based on Compress-PostScript by Carlos Perez.
